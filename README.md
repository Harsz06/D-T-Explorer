# ðŸ•’ Date & Time Mini Project

This mini project is a hands-on exploration of how to work with date and time in programming. I built it to enhance my understanding of key concepts such as formatting dates, parsing time values, calculating time differences, and building real-time clocks and timers. 

By experimenting with these features, I was able to strengthen my skills in manipulating and displaying time-based data effectively. This project not only helped me understand the basics more clearly but also gave me practical experience in implementing time-related logic in code.

## ðŸš€ What I Learned

- Date and time formatting
- Parsing and manipulating date objects
- Calculating time differences
- Creating real-time clocks and countdown timers
- Handling edge cases with dates and time zones
